# üì¶ How to Find Your GitHub Packages

## üîç Where to Look for Your Packages

GitHub packages can be found in several locations depending on how they were published:

### 1. **Repository-Level Packages** (Most Common)

Your packages should appear here:

- Go to: https://github.com/Larouex/LarouexComponents
- Look for a **"Packages"** section on the right sidebar of your repository
- OR click the **"Packages"** tab if it's visible at the top

### 2. **User-Level Packages**

If not in the repository, check your user profile:

- Go to: https://github.com/Larouex?tab=packages
- This shows all packages associated with your account

### 3. **Organization-Level Packages** (if applicable)

If your repository is under an organization:

- Go to the organization page
- Click the "Packages" tab

## üîß If You Don't See the Packages Tab or Section

### Check GitHub Actions Status First

1. Go to: https://github.com/Larouex/LarouexComponents/actions
2. Look for the "Build and Publish NuGet Package" workflow
3. Check if it completed successfully (green checkmark) or failed (red X)

### Common Reasons Packages Don't Appear

1. **Workflow Failed**

   - The GitHub Actions workflow might have encountered an error
   - Check the Actions tab for failed builds

2. **Package Not Published Yet**

   - The workflow might still be running
   - First-time publishing can take a few minutes

3. **Permissions Issue**

   - The workflow needs proper permissions to publish
   - GitHub token might need additional scopes

4. **Package Visibility**
   - Private packages might not be visible depending on your view
   - Public packages should be visible to everyone

## üéØ Quick Steps to Check

1. **First, check repository packages:**

   ```
   https://github.com/Larouex/LarouexComponents
   ```

   Look for "Packages" in the right sidebar

2. **If not there, check your profile packages:**

   ```
   https://github.com/Larouex?tab=packages
   ```

3. **Check workflow status:**
   ```
   https://github.com/Larouex/LarouexComponents/actions
   ```

## üîç Alternative: Search for Your Package

You can also search for your package using the GitHub package search:

- Go to: https://github.com/search?type=packages
- Search for: `LarouexSoftwareDevelopment.LarouexComponents`

## üõ†Ô∏è If the Package Still Isn't There

The most likely scenario is that the GitHub Actions workflow needs to complete successfully first. Let's check the workflow status and troubleshoot if needed.
