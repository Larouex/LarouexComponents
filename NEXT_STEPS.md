# ðŸš€ Next Steps After Push

## 1. ðŸ“Š Check GitHub Actions Status

Visit your repository and check the GitHub Actions status:

- Go to: https://github.com/Larouex/LarouexComponents
- Click the "Actions" tab
- Look for the "Build and Publish NuGet Package" workflow
- The workflow should be running or completed

## 2. ðŸ“¦ Verify Package Publication

Once the workflow completes successfully:

- Go to: https://github.com/Larouex/LarouexComponents/packages
- You should see your package listed: `LarouexSoftwareDevelopment.LarouexComponents`

## 3. ðŸ”§ What to Do If the Workflow Fails

If you see a red X (failed workflow):

1. Click on the failed workflow
2. Click on the failed job
3. Expand the failed step to see the error
4. Common issues:
   - Missing permissions (GitHub token needs `write:packages`)
   - Build errors (check the build step)
   - Test failures (check the test step)

## 4. ðŸŽ¯ Manual Package Check

You can also check if the package was published by running:

```bash
dotnet nuget search LarouexSoftwareDevelopment.LarouexComponents --source "https://nuget.pkg.github.com/Larouex/index.json"
```

## 5. ðŸ”„ If You Need to Republish

To publish a new version:

1. Update version in `LarouexComponents.csproj`
2. Commit and push changes
3. The workflow will automatically run again

## 6. ðŸ“‹ Ready for Testing

Once the package is published, we'll create a test project to consume it!
